# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?

I feel like my confidence is building, but I think I need a lot of practice to get the syntax down. I feel like most of the time, my logic is sound, but I make errors with quotations, parenthesis, brackets, etc. 
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own? 

I dont feel too confident. I think I need more practice and repetition

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)

Can you override a method? Like if I create a method, but later I want it to stop following the method instructions, is that possible?
